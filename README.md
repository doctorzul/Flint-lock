# FlintLock ðŸª¨
A minimalist Minecraft datapack that rebalances survival with harder crafting recipes â€” flint tools, tougher enchanting, and more.
FlintLock is a lightweight Minecraft datapack designed to make early-game survival more challenging and progression more meaningful. It replaces and adjusts several vanilla recipes to better reward exploration and resource management.

## Key Features ðŸ’¡
- Flint Tools: Stone Tools are out. Now youâ€™ll need Flint to craft your second set of tools.
- Harder Enchanting Table: Requires Crying Obsidian instead of regular obsidian. Magic comes at a price.
- Costlier Smithing Template Cloning: No more cheap trims! Youâ€™ll need a full Block of Diamond to copy one.

Some other recipe tweaks aimed at encouraging exploration and smarter resource usage.

## Installation ðŸ“¦
1. Drop the FlintLock folder into your worldâ€™s datapacks directory.
2. Run /reload in-game if the world is already loaded.
3. Recipes will automatically register and override where applicable.

## Compatibility ðŸ“Œ
Built for [Minecraft 1.21.4] onwards (hopefully!)
Does not require any mods or external tools

## Behind The Scenes ðŸ§ 
A fun project, which I'm also using to get more used to doing stuff on GitHub.
Wiki tbd!
Ideally, this datapack will be updated to allow for all game items to be craftable and obtainable in Peaceful Mode!
